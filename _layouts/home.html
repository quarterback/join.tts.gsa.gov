          The Fine Arts Collection is one of the nation's oldest and largest public art collections dating from the 1850s to the present. These civic artworks are displayed in federal buildings and courthouses nationwide. <br />
          
          <br>
          In addition, more than 23,000 easel paintings, prints, and small-scale sculptures created during the New Deal are on long-term loan to museums and other non-profit institutions across the United States. Maintained by GSA as a part of America's national and cultural heritage, the Fine Arts Collection also serves as a reminder of the important tradition of individual creative expression.
